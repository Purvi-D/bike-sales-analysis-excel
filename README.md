# Bike Sales Analysis – Customer Purchase Behaviour Dashboard (Excel)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This project analyses bike sales data to understand customer purchasing behaviour and identify the key factors influencing bike purchases.</br>
Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned raw data, performed exploratory analysis using pivot tables, and developed an interactive dashboard to uncover trends across age groups, income levels, gender, and regions.</br>
The analysis highlights which customer segments are most likely to purchase bikes and provides data-driven recommendations to support targeted marketing and sales strategy.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM

The company wants to increase bike sales but lacks clarity on:</br>
•	Which customer segments are most likely to purchase bikes</br>
•	Whether income impacts purchasing decisions</br>
•	Which regions perform best</br>
•	How demographic factors influence buying behaviour</br>
Without data-driven insights, marketing efforts may be inefficient and poorly targeted.

## METHODOLOGY

The project followed a structured analytical approach:</br>
**1. Data Cleaning**
-	Standardised categorical values (e.g., M/F to Male/Female)
-	Created Age Brackets (Young, Middle Age, Old)
- Ensured data consistency and formatting
-	Preserved raw dataset integrity

**2. Data Analysis**
-	Built pivot tables to analyse:
    -	Purchase behaviour by age group
    -	Income impact on bike purchases
    -	Regional sales performance
    -	Gender-based purchasing trends
-	Calculated purchase rate percentages
  
**3. Dashboard Development**
-	Created KPI metrics:
  -	Total Customers
  -	Total Bike Purchases
  -	Purchase Rate (%)
-	Integrated slicers for interactive filtering
-	Designed a clean and user-friendly layout
