# Bike Sales Analysis – Customer Purchase Behaviour Dashboard (Excel)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This project analyses bike sales data to understand customer purchasing behaviour and identify the key factors influencing bike purchases.</br>
Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned raw data, performed exploratory analysis using pivot tables, and developed an interactive dashboard to uncover trends across age groups, income levels, gender, and regions.</br>
The analysis highlights which customer segments are most likely to purchase bikes and provides data-driven recommendations to support targeted marketing and sales strategy.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM

The company wants to increase bike sales but lacks clarity on:</br>
•	Which customer segments are most likely to purchase bikes</br>
•	Whether income impacts purchasing decisions</br>
•	Which regions perform best</br>
•	How demographic factors influence buying behaviour</br>
Without data-driven insights, marketing efforts may be inefficient and poorly targeted.

## METHODOLOGY

The project followed a structured analytical approach:</br>
1. Data Cleaning</br>
•	Standardised categorical values (e.g., M/F to Male/Female)</br>
•	Created Age Brackets (Young, Middle Age, Old)</br>
•	Ensured data consistency and formatting</br>
•	Preserved raw dataset integrity</br>
2. Data Analysis</br>
•	Built pivot tables to analyse:</br>
o	Purchase behaviour by age group</br>
o	Income impact on bike purchases</br>
o	Regional sales performance</br>
o	Gender-based purchasing trends</br>
•	Calculated purchase rate percentages</br>
3. Dashboard Development</br>
•	Created KPI metrics:</br>
o	Total Customers</br>
o	Total Bike Purchases</br>
o	Purchase Rate (%)</br>
•	Integrated slicers for interactive filtering</br>
•	Designed a clean and user-friendly layout</br>
